os.Open, os.Mkdir, os.Exit
os.Exit: when you need to abort the program immediately and also return an error code so that other programs can use to report what happened
        OR when you already  know that after this one test fail, the other will fail as well, so you might as well just exit now
        OR when your program has done everything it needed to do, and now just needs to exit
