function that is called with the varying number of arguments
"user is allowed to pass zero or more arguments", eg. fmt.Printf

in declaration:
	type of last parameter is preceded by an ellipsis i.e, (...)
	it indicates that the function can be called at any number of parameters of this type

syntax:
	function function_name(para1, para2...type)type {// code...}

    ...type behaves like a slice
