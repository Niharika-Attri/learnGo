Method: is like a function but receives a special argument which is the receiver
    receiver: a type that can direcly call the function
method consists of: 'func' keyword, 'receiver' argument, 'function body'

3 step process
    1. create a type
    2. create a getter
    3. create a method

function gets associated with struct
    function can only be used when used with the struct
    eg. let admin and customer be stucts, as they will have roles/functions assigned to them, and be only used by them we can use reciever function so that the respective functions can only be used by the respective struct
